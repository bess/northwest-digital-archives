=Material Girl
A materialized path parser lib for Ruby.

==What?
Basically, let's say you have an array of objects. Each of those objects has a field that signifies its place in some arbitrary hierarchy:

  docs = [
    {:path=>'colors::red'},
    {:path=>'colors::blue'},
    {:path=>'colors::blue::light'},
    {:path=>'colors::purple'}
    {:path=>'colors::purple::dark'}
  ]

  composite = MaterialGirl.parse(docs) do |doc|
    doc[:path].split('::')
  end

"composite" is now a root composite object that has put the structure above into something like:
  root
    colors
      red
      blue
        light
      purple
        dark

==MaterialGirl::Composite
MaterialGirl.parse returns a MaterialGirl::Composite object. This composite thingy has some nice methods for working with the resulting tree:

  root = MaterialGirl.parse(array_of_things)
  root.children
  root.descendants
  root.descendants.last.ancestors
  root.children.first.siblings
