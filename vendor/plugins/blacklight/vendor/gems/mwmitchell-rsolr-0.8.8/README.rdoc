=RSolr

A Ruby client for Apache Solr. Has transparent JRuby support by using "org.apache.solr.servlet.DirectSolrConnection" as a connection adapter.

==Installation:
  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  sudo gem install mwmitchell-rsolr

==Simple usage:
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rsolr'
  rsolr = RSolr.connect
  
  # sends a request to /select
  response = rsolr.select(:q=>'*:*')
  
  # send a request to a custom request handler; /catalog
  response = rsolr.send_request('/catalog', :q=>'*:*')
  
  # alternative to above (uses Ruby's method_missing):
  response = rsolr.catalog :q=>'*:*'

To run tests:
  
  Copy an Apache Solr 1.3.0/or later (http://apache.seekmeup.com/lucene/solr/1.3.0/) distribution into this directory and rename to "apache-solr"
  Start Solr HTTP:    rake rsolr:start_test_server
  MRI Ruby:           rake
  JRuby:              jruby -S rake

To get a connection in MRI/standard Ruby:
  
  solr = RSolr.connect

To change the Solr HTTP host:
  
  solr = RSolr.connect(:url=>'http://solrserver.com')

To get a direct connection (no http) in jRuby using DirectSolrConnection:
  
  solr = RSolr.connect({
    :adapter=>:direct,
    :home_dir=>'/path/to/solr/home',
    :dist_dir=>'/path/to/solr/distribution'
  })

== Requests
Once you have a connection, you can execute queries, updates etc..

=== Querying
Use the #select method to send requests to the /select handler:
  response = solr.select({
    :q=>'washington',
    :start=>0,
    :rows=>10
  })
  
Use the #send_request method to set a custom request handler path:
  response = solr.send_request('/documents', {:q=>'test'})


=== Updating Solr
Updating can be done using native Ruby structures. Hashes are used for single documents and arrays are used for a collection of documents (hashes). These structures get turned into simple XML "messages". Raw XML can also be used of course.

Raw XML via  #update
  solr.update('</commit>')
  solr.update('</optimize>')

Single document via #add
  solr.add(:id=>1, :price=>1.00)

Multiple documents via #add
  documents = [{:id=>1, :price=>1.00}, {:id=>2, :price=>10.50}]
  solr.add(documents)

When adding, you can also supply "add" xml element attributes and/or a block for manipulating other "add" related elements (docs and fields) when using the #add method:
  
  doc = {:id=>1, :price=>1.00}
  add_attributes = {:allowDups=>false, :commitWithin=>10.0}
  solr.add(doc, add_attributes) do |doc|
    # boost each document
    doc.attrs[:boost] = 1.5
    # boost the price field:
    doc.field_by_name(:price).attrs[:boost] = 2.0
  end

Delete by id
  solr.delete_by_id(1)
or an array of ids
  solr.delete_by_id([1, 2, 3, 4])

Delete by query:
  solr.delete_by_query('price:1.00')
Delete by array of queries
  solr.delete_by_query(['price:1.00', 'price:10.00'])


Commit & optimize shortcuts
  solr.commit
  solr.optimize


== Response Formats
The default response format is Ruby. When the :wt param is set to :ruby, the response is eval'd and wrapped up in a nice Mash (Hash) class. You can get a raw response by setting the :wt to "ruby" - notice, the string -- not a symbol. All other response formats are available as expected, :wt=>'xml' etc..

===Evaluated Ruby (default)
  solr.select(:wt=>:ruby) # notice :ruby is a Symbol
===Raw Ruby
  solr.select(:wt=>'ruby') # notice 'ruby' is a String

===XML:
  solr.select(:wt=>:xml)
===JSON:
  solr.select(:wt=>:json)

You can access the original request context (path, params, url etc.) by calling the #adapter_response method:
  response = solr.select(:q=>'*:*')
  response.adapter_response[:status_code]
  response.adapter_response[:body]
  response.adapter_response[:url]

The adapter_response is a hash that contains the generated params, url, path, post data, headers etc., very useful for debugging and testing.


== HTTP Client Adapter
You can specify the http client adapter to use by setting solr.adapter.connector.adapter_name to one of:
  :net_http     uses the standard Net::HTTP library
  :curb         uses the Ruby "curl" bindings

Example:
	
  solr.adapter.connector.adapter_name = :curb

Example of using the HTTP client only:
  
  hclient = RSolr::HTTPClient::Connector.new(:curb).connect(url)
  hclient = RSolr::HTTPClient::Connector.new(:net_http).connect(url)
  hclient.get('/')

After reading this http://apocryph.org/2008/11/09/more_indepth_analysis_ruby_http_client_performance - I would recommend using the :curb adapter. NOTE: You can't use the :curb adapter under jRuby. To install curb:

  sudo gem install curb
