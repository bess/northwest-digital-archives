            Please note: The main <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> website is <a

            <h1>Installing <a href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a></h1>
            <h2>Some background information</h2>
            <p>
            <a href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> is open source
            discovery software. Libraries (or anyone else) can use blacklight to enable
            searching and browsing of their collections online. <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> uses Solr to
            index and search text and/or metadata, and it has a highly configurable
            Ruby on Rails front-end. Currently, <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> can index,
            search, and provide faceted browsing for MaRC records and EAD XML files,
            and support is planned for Dublin Core and MODS as well. <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> was originally
            developed at the University of Virginia Library and is made public under an
            Apache 2.0 license. As of version 2.2.0 (released June 8, 2009), <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> is distributed as
            an engines plugin and as a demo application that uses the engines plugin.
            </p>
            <h2>Which one should I install?</h2>
            <p>
            There are two ways of installing <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a>. You can either
            install a pre-configured demo app, which already has the <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> plugin installed
            and integrated, or you can install the plugin into an existing rails
            application.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you&#8217;re just getting started with <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> and want to get
            something up and running relatively quickly, start by installing the demo
            app. This will give you a good introduction to the pieces of the <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> system before you
            start customizing your own installation.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you want to integrate <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> search and
            discovery into another rails app, or if you already have a customized copy
            of <a href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> and you
            only want to upgrade the plugin, you want the plugin installation
            instructions.
            </p>
            <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
            <p>
            Whichever method you choose for installation, be sure you have all the
            pre-requisites in place. You can find these detailed in <a
            href="PRE-REQUISITES_rdoc.html">PRE-REQUISITES.rdoc</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Installing the demo app</h2>
            <p>
            Instructions for installing the demo app are contained in the file
            DEMO_README
            </p>
            <h2>Installing the plugin into an existing rails app</h2>
            <p>
            Instructions for installing the demo app are contained in the
            plugin&#8217;s <a href="README_rdoc.html">README.rdoc</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Running solr</h2>
            <p>
            You&#8217;ll also want some information about how <a
            href="../../../../classes/Blacklight.html">Blacklight</a> expects solr to
            run, which you can find in <a
            href="README_SOLR_rdoc.html">README_SOLR.rdoc</a>
