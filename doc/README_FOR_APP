=Blacklight


==Getting Started

Export or checkout a copy of blacklight from RubyForge. You'll need a Subversion client:

  svn co svn+ssh://mwmitchell@rubyforge.org/var/svn/blacklight/trunk blacklight


==Installing Dependencies


===Ruby and Ruby Gems
Information on installing Ruby and Ruby Gems can be found:
	
	http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
	http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3


===Individual Ruby Gems
* sudo gem install marc
* sudo gem install rails
* sudo gem install Linguistics


===ImageMagick - "ImageMagick® is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images."
Blacklight features a user feedback form. The form makes use of the "simple_captcha" plugin (included). In order for this form to work properly, the ImageMagick libraries must be installed. You can follow the instructions here http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php for installing from source or install a binary from here: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php

On fedora, you can try:

	sudo yum install ImageMagick ImageMagick-devel

Test your installation of ImageMagick:

	convert -version

You should see something like:
  
  Version: ImageMagick 6.4.5 2008-11-04 Q16 OpenMP http://www.imagemagick.org
  Copyright: Copyright (C) 1999-2008 ImageMagick Studio LLC


===RMagick - "RMagick is an interface between the Ruby programming language and the ImageMagick® and GraphicsMagick image processing libraries."
RMagick is used to "talk" to ImageMagick. It can be installed by using the Ruby Gems installer:

	sudo gem install rmagick

Test your RMagick installation:
	
	irb
	require 'rubygems'
	require 'RMagick'

* tip: If you get an error about a shared object file not found, try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH before starting irb. If setting this path works, you'll need to set it before starting the Rails server as well.


===Setup
Within a shell, change into the downloaded trunk directory:

cd blacklight

Start solr:
	
	./scripts/start_solr (starts solr and availability service)

Then change into the "rails" directory:

	cd rails

Copy the config/database.example file to config/database.yml and make your database config changes:
	
	cp config/database.example config/database.yml


Copy the config/solr.example file to config/solr.yml and make your solr config changes:
	
	cp config/solr.example config/solr.yml


Run the database migrations
	
	rake db:migrate

Start the web server:
	open new terminal window
	cd <directory of blacklight/rails>
	./script/server
