Move user authentication checks in application controller to users controller?

Un-do the uva_development/environment stuff? We could move environments/* to environments/*.example like the config files to be more consistent.

Remove Flare entirely? Make the request/response stuff a wrapper around solr-ruby? A new version of solr-ruby might be coming, probably best to upgrade if that happens... If not, move Flare stuff to:

	Blacklight::Solr
	
	Change @flare references to @response or @result etc..

Put @solr_connection in environment, so it's available "everywhere"? Singleton?

When adding a facet from /catalog/facet/xxx, the :offset and :id params get added to the constraints

Override finders in solr-ruby/flare to wrap/extend UVA (or other) specific module extensions

special app-instances config in initializers/ ?
	set app dir
	set public url
	modify load_paths
	etc.

Find way to integrate solr doc, flare doc, uva doc, and DocMeta
	current implementation is fragile and quite messy

Move code base GitHub? This would make it *very easy* for people to fork and contribute  fixes/additions.

Lighthouse instead of private/internal Jira? Something else that allow people outside of UVa to view/add? Just use rubyforge(yuk) ?

For web service wrappers (google books, syndetics etc.) use?

=Ideas for making Blacklight customizable:
	
	Convert to gem
	Add hook methods in Blacklight module/environment
	
	See spree ecommerce framework -- very good override scheme (like RailsEngines but better)
	
	===Load Paths
	remove:
		app/views/*
		app/controllers/*
		app/helpers/*

	add lib/<custom>/app
			views
			controllers
			helpers

	Then append the lib/custom/views to config.view_paths and controlers+helpers to config.load_path
